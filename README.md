# Email Spam Detector

A Python-based email spam classification system that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**. The project includes preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization components.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Spam emails are unsolicited and often unwanted messages that clutter inboxes and can pose security risks. This project builds an automated system that accurately identifies whether an email is spam using machine learning.

✔️ Preprocesses email text data  
✔️ Trains a classification model on labeled dataset  
✔️ Evaluates model performance with metrics and plots  
✔️ Saves trained model for inference

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adarshthakur-850/Email-Spam-Detector.git
   cd Email-Spam-Detector
````

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

### 📌 Train the Model

```bash
python main.py train
```

This will preprocess the dataset, fit the model, and save it to the `models/` folder.

### 📌 Predict on New Emails

```bash
python main.py predict
```

Enter email text when prompted — the system will classify it as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

## 📊 Evaluation

After training, evaluation metrics and plots (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy scores) are stored in the `plots/` directory. Use them to analyze model performance.

## 💡 Example Output

```
Enter email text: "Congratulations! You've won a free trip!"
Prediction: SPAM
Confidence: 93%
```
